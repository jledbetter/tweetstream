tweetstream
-----------------------

You must setup a JMS topic within the admin console to run this app:

Name: twitter

JNDI name: /topic/twitter All the others: by default.

In the same form we need to add roles for that topic. For that demo application we will create single role with next parameters:

Name: guest

Send: yes

Consume: yes

create subscriber: yes

delete subscriber: yes

create durable subscriber: yes

delete durable subscriber: yes
